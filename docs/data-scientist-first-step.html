<p>When dealing with NA (missing) values in data analysis, here are a few suggestions to consider:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Identify</strong> the presence of NA values: Begin by checking your data to identify the presence of NA values. This can be done using functions like <code>is.na()</code> or <code>complete.cases()</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Understand</strong> the nature of missingness: It’s essential to understand why the NA values exist in your data. Are they at random or systematic? This understanding can help inform the appropriate handling strategy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Analyze</strong> missing data patterns: It can be insightful to analyze the patterns and relationships between missing values and other variables. This analysis can provide additional insights into the reasons for missingness and potential biases in your data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Remove</strong> NA values: In some cases, you may choose to remove rows or columns with NA values if they are not critical for your analysis. This can be done using functions like <code>na.omit()</code> or <code>complete.cases()</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impute</strong> missing values: If the NA values are significant and removing them would result in a loss of valuable information, you can impute (replace) them with estimated values. Common imputation methods include mean imputation, median imputation, or using more advanced techniques like regression imputation or multiple imputation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Document and report</strong> missing data handling: Whichever approach you choose, it’s important to document and report how you handled missing data. This ensures transparency and allows others to understand the impact of missing data on your analysis.</p></li>

<p>Some common considerations for data preprocessing include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cleaning the <strong>column names</strong> to ensure they are consistent and easy to work with.</li>
<li>Handling <strong>missing data</strong></li>
<li>Creating <strong>unique indices</strong> for all data points</li>
<li>Lowercasing all character vectors (i.e., text columns) to <strong>normalize</strong> the letter casing</li>
<li>Identifying <strong>duplicate</strong> tokens within the dataset</li>
<li>Creating new columns that better reflect the factors of interest, such as:
<ul>
<li><code>Decade</code></li>
<li><code>Prize_Age</code></li>
</ul></li>

<p>Please note that the necessity of the aforementioned preprocessing steps may vary depending on the characteristics of your dataset and the specific research questions you are addressing. It is important to carefully consider which preprocessing steps are relevant and applicable to your particular case.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the order in which these preprocessing steps are performed is not arbitrary and can have an impact on the outcomes of your analysis. The optimal ordering of preprocessing steps may vary depending on the nature of your data and the objectives of your research. It is advisable to take into account the specific requirements and considerations of your study when determining the most appropriate order for performing these steps.</p>

<div class="alert">
<p>Given two positive integers, normally, we define the division as follows: <code>a / b</code> in R.
There are two variants of the integer division:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>a %% b</code> (a modulo b): This <strong>modulo operation</strong> will return the <strong>remainder</strong> of the division (The expression <code>5 %% 3</code> would evaluate to <code>2</code>).</li>
<li><code>a %/% b</code>: This <strong>integer division</strong> operation will return the <strong>quotient</strong> of the division (The expression <code>5 %/% 3</code> would evaluate to <code>1</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p>We often use this modulo operation to check if an output value is a multiple of a specific integer.</p>
</div>
<p>We can check if our new <code>Prize_Age</code> has any <code>NA</code> values?</p>

<p>After performing data preprocessing, the next step is to conduct exploratory data analysis. As mentioned in <a href="data-visualization.html#data-visualization">Chapter 7</a>, data visualization is often a useful starting point for exploratory analysis.</p>
<p>In this section, we will explore how to generate relevant statistics and graphs based on different research questions. By utilizing these tools, we can gain insights and uncover patterns in the data, helping us better understand the underlying relationships and trends.</p>

<p><code>geom_density_ridges()</code> is a visualization function from the <code>ggridges</code> package in R. It allows you to create ridgeline plots, also known as density ridgeline plots or joyplots. These plots display the density distribution of a variable across different categories or groups.</p>
<p>The function <code>geom_density_ridges()</code> takes your data and maps a continuous variable to the y-axis to represent the density. The x-axis represents the categories or groups you want to compare. Each category is represented by a ridgeline, and the density of the variable is visualized as the height or thickness of the ridgeline.</p>
<p>This visualization is useful for comparing the distributions of a continuous variable across different groups, as it provides a clear and compact representation of the density curves for each group. It allows you to identify variations in the density and explore patterns or differences between groups in a visually appealing manner.</p>
