<p>Most of the time, we need to work with our own data. In this chapter, we will learn the fundamental concepts and techniques in data I/O (input/output). In particular, we have two main objectives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn how to load our data in R from external files</li>
<li>Learn how to save our data in R to external files</li>
</ul>
<div id="overview" class="section level2" number="10.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">10.1</span> Overview</h2>
<p>There are two major file types that data analysts often work with: <code>txt</code> and <code>csv</code> files.</p>
<p>Following the spirit of tidy structure, we will introduce the package, <code>readr</code>, which is also part of the <code>tidyverse</code>. This package provides several useful functions for R users to load their data efficiently from plain-text files.</p>
<p>In particular, we will introduce the most effective functions: <code>read_csv()</code> and <code>write_csv()</code> for the loading of CSV files.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">10.3</span> What is a <code>CSV</code> file? (Self-study)</h2>
<p>A CSV is a <strong>c</strong>omma-<strong>s</strong>eparated <strong>v</strong>alues file, which allows data to be saved in a tabular format. CSVs look like a spreadsheet but with a <code>.csv</code> extension.</p>
<p>A CSV file has a fairly simple structure. It’s a list of data separated by commas. For example, let’s say you have a few contacts in a contact manager, and you export them as a CSV file. You’d get a file containing texts like this:</p>
<pre><code>Name,Email,Phone Number,Address
Bob Smith,bob@example.com,123-456-7890,123 Fake Street
Mike Jones,mike@example.com,098-765-4321,321 Fake Avenue</code></pre>
<p>CSV files can be easily viewed with any of the text editors (e.g., Notepad++, TextEdit), or spreadsheet programs, such as Microsoft Excel or Google Spreadsheets. But you can only have one single sheet in a file and all data are kept as normal texts in the file.</p>
<div id="why-are-.csv-files-used" class="section level3" number="10.3.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">10.3.1</span> Why are <code>.CSV</code> files used?</h3>
<p>There are several advantages of using <code>CSV</code> files for data exchange:</p>
<ul>
<li>CSV files are plain-text files, making them easier for the developer to create</li>
<li>Since they’re plain text, they’re easier to import into a spreadsheet or another storage database, regardless of the specific software you’re using</li>
<li>To better organize large amounts of data</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="how-do-i-save-csv-files" class="section level3" number="10.3.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">10.3.2</span> How do I save CSV files?</h3>
<p>Saving CSV files is relatively easy. You just need to know where to change the file type. With a normal spreadsheet application (e.g., MS Excel), under the “File” section in the “Save As” tab, you can select it and change default file extension to "CSV (Comma delimited) (*.csv)".</p>
<div class="info">
<p>
Although people mostly use the comma character to separate (or delimit) data, sometimes people use other characters like the tab, i.e., <code>\t</code>. Therefore, sometimes people use the file extension <code>TSV</code> to indicate that the tabular data in the file are delimited by <code>tab</code> (indicating the column boundaries).
</p>
<p>
Please also note that all these tabular files can be named with the extension <code>.txt</code> as well. However, a more intuitive file extension is definitely better for data management.

<div id="what-about-other-types-of-data" class="section level3" number="10.3.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">10.3.3</span> What about other types of data?</h3>
<p>In data analysis, we sometimes may need to deal with some other types of data files in addition to the plain-texts. For the import/export of other types of data, R also has specific packages designed for them:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>haven</code> - SPSS, Stata, and SAS files</li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">10.4</span> Character Encoding (Self-study)</h2>
<p>Before we move on to the functions for data I/O, I would like to talk about the issues of character encoding.</p>
<p>For all characters in languages, computers use numbers like 1 and 0 to encode all these characters. The more characters a language has, the more numbers are needed in the encoding.</p>
<p>For example, for an English text, it usually consists of only Latin alphabets, and limited sets of essential numbers and punctuation marks. A 7-bit encoding scheme is enough to cover all the possible characters in English. The <strong>7-bit</strong> encoding gives us the maximum of 128 (2<sup>7</sup> = 128) possible different characters to encode: each <strong>coding number</strong> corresponds to one unique character.</p>
<p>The <strong>ASCII</strong> (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) encoding, a 7-bit character encoding developed from telegraph code, is a well-known encoding for English texts.</p>

<p>You can play with the following methods of loading the text files into R. Like I said, the above method is always recommended. It seems that the encoding settings within the <code>readlines()</code> or other R-native data loading functions (e.g., <code>scan()</code>) do not always work properly. (This is due to the variation of the operation systems and also the default locale of the OS.)</p>

<p>It is said that <code>writeLines()</code> will attempt to <em>re-encode</em> the provided text to the native encoding of the system. This works fine when the system default is UTF-8. But in Windows, the default is NOT UTF-8.</p>
<p>I can’t say I fully understand how the encoding system works with Windows. If you would like to know more about this, please refer to this article: <a href="https://kevinushey.github.io/blog/2018/02/21/string-encoding-and-r/">String Encoding and R</a>.</p>

<p>The <code>csv</code> file is in fact a normal plain-text file. Each line consists of a row data, with the columns separated by <code>commas</code>. Sometimes we may receive a data set with other self-defined characters as the delimiter.</p>
<p>Another often-seen case is to use the <code>tab</code> as the delimiter. Files with <code>tab</code> as the delimiter are often with the extension <code>tsv</code>. In <code>readr</code>, we can use <code>read_tsv()</code> to read <code>tsv</code> files.</p>

<div id="directory-operations" class="section level2" number="10.8">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">10.8</span> Directory Operations</h2>
<p>When we work with external files, we often need to deal with directories as well. Most importantly, we need to know both the <em>paths</em> and <em>filenames</em> of the external data in order to properly load the data into R.</p>
<div id="working-directory" class="section level3" number="10.8.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">10.8.1</span> Working Directory</h3>
<p><img src="images/working-directory.png" width="882" /></p>
<p>Whenever you start the RStudio, R will take a directory as the working directory.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you start RStudio with the app icon, Rstudio will take your <strong>system default directory</strong> as the working directory.</li>
<li>If you start Rstudio by opening a specific R script, RStudio will take the script <strong>source file location</strong> as the working directory.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="relative-vs.-absolute-paths" class="section level3" number="10.8.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">10.8.2</span> Relative vs. Absolute Paths</h3>
<p>There are two ways to tell R where your external file is. You can always specify the <strong>full path</strong> to your file:</p>
<pre><code>&quot;C:/Users/Alvin/Documents/ENC2055/demo_data/data-bnc-bigrams.csv&quot;</code></pre>
<p>However, it can be very troublesome if we need to specify the full paths all the time.</p>
<hr />
<p>The other alternative is to specify the <strong>relative path</strong> to the file in relation to the <strong>current working directory</strong>. That is, the file paths start with the working directory. By default, R will look for the file path from the <strong>working directory</strong> of the current R session.</p>
<p>For example, in the following code, R will look for a file called <code>data-bnc-bigram.csv</code> under the working directory. If there is no such file, you will get an error message.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb41"><pre class="sourceCode r Rchunk"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb41-1"><a href="data-import.html#cb41-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>x <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu">read_csv</span>(<span class="st">&quot;data-bnc-bigram.csv&quot;</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In the following code, R will look for a sub-directory under the working directory called <code>demo_data</code>, and within the <code>demo_data</code> sub-directory, R will further look for the file <code>data-bnc-bigram-csv</code>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb42"><pre class="sourceCode r Rchunk"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb42-1"><a href="data-import.html#cb42-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>x <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu">read_csv</span>(<span class="st">&quot;demo_data/data-bnc-bigram.csv&quot;</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In the following code, R will look for a file called <code>data-bnc-bigram.csv</code> from the <strong>parent directory</strong> of the working directory.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb43"><pre class="sourceCode r Rchunk"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb43-1"><a href="data-import.html#cb43-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>x <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu">read_csv</span>(<span class="st">&quot;../data-bnc-bigram.csv&quot;</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="info">
<p>When using the relative path to specify file locations, the <code>..</code> signifies the parent directory of the current working directory. People sometimes use the <code>.</code> to refer to the current working directory.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="directory-operations-1" class="section level3" number="10.8.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">10.8.3</span> Directory Operations</h3>
<p>There are a few important directory operations that we often need when working with files (import/export):</p>
<ul>
<li><code>getwd()</code>: check the working directory of the current R session</li>
<li><code>setwd()</code>: set the working directory for the current R session</li>
</ul>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb44"><pre class="sourceCode r Rchunk"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb44-1"><a href="data-import.html#cb44-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">getwd</span>()</span>
<span id="cb44-2"><a href="data-import.html#cb44-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">setwd</span>()</span></code></pre></div>
<p>By default, R looks for the <em>filename</em> or the <em>path</em> under the <strong>working directory</strong> unless the <strong>absolute/relative</strong> path to the files/directories is particularly specified.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb45"><pre class="sourceCode r Rchunk"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb45-1"><a href="data-import.html#cb45-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">dir</span>(<span class="at">path =</span> <span class="st">&quot;demo_data&quot;</span>,</span>

<hr />
<p>A common scenario is that we often need to load all the files from a specific <strong>directory</strong>. This usually requires a few steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, we need to get a list of the <strong>filenames</strong> included in the directory.</li>
<li>Then we need to load the data of each file into R based on the filenames.</li>
</ul>
