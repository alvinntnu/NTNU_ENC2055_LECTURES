This tutorial is to show you how to use the ChatGPT service with R, which in turn can provide you additional assistance in future R scripts. C.1 Installation You can install the package from CRAN using the following command: # install.packages(&quot;remotes&quot;) remotes::install_github(&quot;jcrodriguez1989/chatgpt&quot;) Please check the chatgpt package documentation for more information about installation, setup, and usage. C.2 ChatGPT API API stands for Application Programming Interface. You can see it as a set of rules that lets different computer programs talk to each other. It is often needed when developers like to use service from an application. For example, when you use a self-created script to access data from YouTube, the script is talking to an API to get the media data. APIs allow different apps and programs to work together to create more complex systems. It’s like a language that different programs use to communicate with each other and share information. To use the ChatGPT service, you need to get an API key from OpenAI. You can get an API key by signing up for the OpenAI API at OPENAI API. After you obtain an OpenAI API, please copy-paste it in a safe document in private space. Please note that the API will no longer be available for copy-and-paste as soon as you closes the pop-up window. Once you have an API key, you can store it in your R environment as an environment variable using the Sys.setenv() function: Sys.setenv(OPENAI_API_KEY = &quot;your_api_key_here&quot;) Make sure to replace your_api_key_here with your actual API key. R Environment Variables Setup You can save the environment variable OPENAI_API_KEY in ~/.Renvion and every time when you starts your R session, the variable will be accessible. (For more information on R settings, please see this artcle.) Run the following code and Rstudio will open the ~/.Renviron file for you: usethis::edit_r_environ() Go to the Rstudio Editing Frame and find the active file tab ~/.Renviron. In the ~/.Renviron, please add the following line to the file: OPENAI_API_KEY=&#39;your_api_key_here&#39; Re-start the RStudio, and run the following code to see if the API key is accessible now. ## Get the environment variables from the system default Sys.getenv(&quot;OPENAI_API_KEY&quot;) Or alternatively, you can save the environment variables at the OS level. Mac and Windows systems have different methods. Please see this article for more information. C.3 Using chatgpt Once you have installed the chatgpt package and set up your API key, you can load the package and specify your OPENAI API KEY (if it is not in your system/R environment variables): library(chatgpt) ## If you have set up environment variable in `~/.Renviron` ## You don&#39;t have to do anything # Sys.getenv(&quot;OPENAI_API_KEY&quot;) ## you can get if the environment variable is working ## If you have not set up the environment variable, ## please specify your OPENAI_API key here # OPENAI_API_KEY = &quot;your_api_key_here&quot; ## uncomment to specify API Parameters ChatGPT model parameters can be tweaked by using more environment variables. The following environment variables variables can be set to tweak the behavior, as documented in https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions/create. OPENAI_VERBOSE: If you want chatgpt not to show question messages in console, please set the environment variable OPENAI_VERBOSE=FALSE. OPENAI_MODEL; defaults to “gpt-3.5-turbo” OPENAI_MAX_TOKENS; defaults to 256 OPENAI_TEMPERATURE; defaults to 1 OPENAI_TOP_P; defaults to 1 OPENAI_FREQUENCY_PENALTY; defaults to 0 OPENAI_PRESENCE_PENALTY; defaults to 0 Sys.setenv(OPENAI_MAX_TOKENS = 2048) ## max for `gpt-3.5-turbo`; 8092 tokens for `gpt-4` !!! Sys.setenv(OPENAI_VERBOSE = FALSE) Ask Questions writeLines( ask_chatgpt( &quot;You are a professional R instructor. Can you give me a few specific suggestions on how to start learning the R programming language?&quot; ) ## endask ) ## endwrite 1. Start by downloading and installing R on your computer. 2. Familiarize yourself with the R syntax by taking an online course or reading a book on the basics of R. 3. Explore the online community of R users by joining forums and participating in discussions. 4. Practice your coding skills by working through tutorials and sample projects. 5. Utilize the wide range of resources available online to learn more about R, such as tutorials, videos, and blogs. 6. Use the RStudio IDE to gain an understanding of R’s features and capabilities. 7. Join a local R user group or attend a conference to network with other R users. 8. Experiment with data and build your own projects to gain a deeper understanding of the language. writeLines( ask_chatgpt( &quot;Could you explain what technical skills a data scientist needs for their career?&quot; ) ## endask ) ## endwrite Data scientists need a variety of technical skills to be successful in their careers. These include: -Proficiency with programming languages such as Python, R, Java, and SQL. -Proficiency in statistical analysis software such as SAS and SPSS. -Expertise in machine learning algorithms and techniques such as deep learning, neural networks, and ensemble methods. -Knowledge of data mining principles and techniques to extract useful insights from large datasets. -Knowledge of data visualization tools such as Tableau, Power BI, and D3.js. -Familiarity with cloud computing platforms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure. -Ability to communicate complex data-driven insights in a clear and concise manner. writeLines( ask_chatgpt( &quot;Can you tell us which programming language is better, Python or R?&quot; ) ## endask ) ## endwrite It is impossible to answer this question definitively because both Python and R are powerful programming languages and each has its own strengths and weaknesses. It really depends on the specific use case and the particular problem being solved. writeLines( ask_chatgpt( &quot;As a humanities student, I&#39;m more comfortable with Shakespeare than with Python. Can you explain why I need to learn programming, besides the fact that it pays better than reciting sonnets on the street corner?&quot; ) ## endask ) ## endwrite Learning to program is essential for a number of reasons, beyond the potential for higher wages. Programming encourages critical thinking, problem-solving, and creativity - all skills that are useful for the modern workplace, regardless of field. Programming can also expand the potential for analyzing, understanding, and interpreting data, which is becoming increasingly important in the Humanities. Furthermore, programming can help you to better understand and interact with technology, which is becoming an ever more integral part of everyday life. writeLines( ask_chatgpt( &quot;How do you convince humanities students who would rather run a marathon in stilettos than sit through a statistics class that the subject is actually important and could make a significant impact on their career trajectory?&quot; ) ## endask ) ## endwrite First, explain that statistics is a powerful tool that is used to analyze data. Demonstrate how data analysis can be used in their field of study and how it can be used to answer questions, draw conclusions, and make predictions. Show them examples of how knowledge of statistics can help them in their career, such as the ability to interpret data to inform decision making, identify trends, and provide insights. Finally, emphasize the practical applications of statistics and how it can be used to solve real-world problems. C.4 R Assistance Overall, ChatGPT can be a useful tool for providing comments and explanations of R scripts. By interacting with ChatGPT, you can get feedback, suggestions, and assistance with debugging and problem-solving. However, it’s important to keep in mind that ChatGPT is a language model and not a human expert, so its suggestions may not always be perfect or tailored to your specific needs. Comment Code Providing feedback on coding style: ChatGPT can provide feedback on coding style, including suggestions for formatting, naming conventions, and best practices. This can help you improve the readability and maintainability of your code. writeLines( comment_code( &quot;for (i in 1:10) {\\n print(i ** 2)\\n}&quot; ) ## endcomment ) ## endwrite # This loop prints the square of each number from 1 to 10 for (i in 1:10) { # looping over the numbers from 1 to 10 print(i ** 2) # prints the square of the current number (i) } Explain Code Providing code explanations: If you have a section of code that you don’t understand, you can ask ChatGPT to explain it to you. For example, you can ask “What does this line of code do?” and ChatGPT can provide an explanation of the code. writeLines( explain_code( &quot;for (i in 1:10) {\\n print(i ** 2)\\n}&quot; ) ## endexplain ) ## endwrite This code is a for loop that prints out the square of each number from 1 to 10. The &quot;for&quot; loop is repeated for each number from 1 to 10, and each time the variable &quot;i&quot; is assigned the corresponding number from the sequence. The line &quot;print(i**2)&quot; prints out the square of the current value of the variable &quot;i&quot;. writeLines( explain_code( &quot;corp %&gt;% mutate(NumOfChars = nchar(texts), VowelPer = str_count(texts,&#39;[aeiou]&#39;)/NumOfChars, ConPer = str_count(texts,&#39;[^aeiou]&#39;)/NumOfChars) %&gt;% pivot_longer(c(&#39;VowelPer&#39;, &#39;ConPer&#39;), names_to = &#39;Segment&#39;,values_to = &#39;Percent&#39;) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(Segment, Percent, fill=Segment)) + geom_boxplot(notch=TRUE)&quot; ) ## endexplain ) ## endwrite This code is using the pipe operator &quot;%&gt;%&quot; to take the dataframe &quot;corp&quot; and perform several data manipulations and visualizations. The first step is to add two new columns to the dataframe, &quot;NumOfChars&quot; and &quot;VowelPer&quot; which count the total number of characters in the &quot;texts&quot; column and calculate the percentage of vowels in the &quot;texts&quot; column respectively. The next step is to use the &quot;pivot_longer&quot; function to reshape the data into a longer format, with two new columns, &quot;Segment&quot; and &quot;Percent&quot;, which represent the percentage of vowels and consonants respectively. Finally, the code uses the &quot;ggplot&quot; function to create a boxplot graph of the &quot;Percent&quot; column, separated by the &quot;Segment&quot; column, with a notch to better represent the data. Document Code writeLines( document_code( &quot;squarenum &lt;- function(x){x^2}&quot; ) ## enddoc ) ## endwrite #&#39; Square a Number #&#39; #&#39; Squares a given number. #&#39; #&#39; @param x A numeric value #&#39; #&#39; @return The square of \\code{x} #&#39; #&#39; @examples #&#39; squarenum(2) #&#39; #&#39; @export #&#39; squarenum &lt;- function(x){ x^2 } #&#39; Squares a Number #&#39; #&#39; This function takes a number as an argument and returns the square of that number. #&#39; #&#39; @param x A number. #&#39; #&#39; @return The square of the number `x`. #&#39; #&#39; @examples #&#39; squarenum(4) #&#39; #&#39; @export #&#39; squarenum &lt;- function(x){ x^2 } Find Issues in Code Debugging assistance: If you are having trouble debugging your code, you can ask ChatGPT to help you find the error. ChatGPT can analyze your code and provide suggestions on where the error might be occurring. writeLines( find_issues_in_code( &quot;x &lt;- data.frame(index = c(1:4), text = letters[1:4]) writeLines(x[1])&quot; ) ## endfind ) ## endwrite 1. The code is missing a closing parenthesis at the end of the first line. 2. The second line should read: writeLines(x[1,] ) to ensure the entire row is printed. Optimize Code Suggesting improvements: If you have a section of code that is not working as expected, you can ask ChatGPT to suggest improvements. ChatGPT can analyze your code and suggest changes that may help fix the problem. Offering alternative solutions: If you are looking for alternative solutions to a coding problem, you can ask ChatGPT for suggestions. ChatGPT can offer different approaches to solving the problem and help you choose the best one for your needs. writeLines(optimize_code( &quot;x &lt;- data.frame(index = c(1:4), text = letters[1:4]) writeLines(x[1])&quot; )) writeLines(x[1, &quot;text&quot;]) writeLines(refactor_code( &quot;x &lt;- data.frame(index = c(1:4), text = letters[1:4]) writeLines(x[1])&quot; )) writeLines(x[x$index == 1, &quot;text&quot;]) C.5 Basic Natural Language Processing Overall, ChatGPT can be a powerful tool for performing basic NLP tasks. However, it’s important to keep in mind that it may not always be perfect or tailored to your specific needs. Additionally, more advanced tasks may require the use of other NLP tools or techniques.
