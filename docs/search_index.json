This is a graduate-level course tailored to those who are interested in computational text analytics and data science in general. Have you decided to embark upon a digital journey to your future career, there are a series of courses provided in the Department of English, NTNU, Taiwan, offerring necessary skills and knowledge in important disciplines. This introductory course in basic computational coding would be a prerequisite course for many other advance-level courses. Also, our Linguistics group is dedicated to linguistics in particular. Course Objective The objective of this course is to provide a comprehensive introduction to programming languages with a special focus on its application in linguistic analyses. This course is especially tailored to those who do not have any background or experiences in coding. We will start from the very basic concepts, such as data types, variable assignments, control structures, to more complex procedures such as routines, functions, and other exploratory project-based tasks. The course consists of a series of theme-based hands-on tutorials, which demonstrate how the flexibility of the programming language can help you become a more efficient and productive data scientist. Specifically, this course will use the language R as our featuring programming language and introduce you to R, Rstudio, and a collection of R packages designed to work together to make linguistic analyses fast, fluent, and fun. By the end of the course, students should have a working knowledge of coding and an initial ability to advance a project independently as a data scientist. In this course, we will not be dealing with complex maths like: \\[ f(x)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi}} e^{-\\frac{1}{2} x^{2}} \\] \\[ P(A) = \\sum P(\\{ (e_1,\\dotsc,e_N) \\}) = \\binom{N}{k} \\cdot p^kq^{N-k} \\] We will not be dealing with lingusitic theories as well. No transformations. No movements. No bindings. This course is all about computational coding. library(tidyverse) summary_monthly_temp &lt;- weather %&gt;% group_by(month) %&gt;% summarize(mean = mean(temp), std_dev = sd(temp)) Textbook Throughout the semester, we will follow the materials provided on our course website (see below). We will not use a particular textbook for the course. However, I do like to recommend Wickham and Grolemund (2017) for its simplicity. Also, another great book for R lovers, by Davies (2016): Course Website We have a course website. You may need a password to get access to the course materials. If you are an officially enrolled student, please ask the instructor for the access code. Course Demo Data Dropbox Demo Data Directory Questions?
