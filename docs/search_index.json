This is a graduate-level course tailored to those who are interested in computational text analytics and data science in general. Have you decided to embark upon a digital journey to your future career, there are a series of courses provided in the Department of English, NTNU, Taiwan, offering necessary skills and knowledge in important disciplines. This introductory course in basic computational coding would be a prerequisite course for many other advance-level courses. In particular, our faculty in the Linguistics track is dedicated to research on both theoretical and applied linguistics. Along with courses offered by other faculty members, this course provides a necessary foundation for the burgeoning discipline of computational linguistics. Please note that while this course has no prerequisite from the students, it will turn out to be a prerequisite for a lot of advanced courses, such as Corpus Linguistics and Computational Linguistics. If you plan to step into this computational way of language processing, you need to take this course (or at least you need to learn how to code.) Course Objective The objective of this course is to provide a comprehensive introduction to programming languages with a special focus on its application in linguistic analyses. This course is especially tailored to those who do not have any background or experiences in coding. We will start from the very basic concepts, such as data types, variable assignments, control structures, to more complex procedures such as routines, functions, and other exploratory project-based tasks. The course consists of a series of theme-based hands-on tutorials, which demonstrate how the flexibility of the programming language can help you become a more efficient and productive data scientist. Specifically, this course will use the language R as our featuring programming language and introduce you to , Rstudio, and a collection of R packages designed to work together to make linguistic analyses fast, fluent, and fun. In addition, we will briefly touch upon a few important constructs with another popular language in data science, Python . By the end of the course, students should have a working knowledge of coding and an initial ability to advance a project independently as a data scientist. In this course, we will not be dealing with complex maths like: \\[ f(x)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi}} e^{-\\frac{1}{2} x^{2}} \\] \\[ P(A) = \\sum P(\\{ (e_1,\\dotsc,e_N) \\}) = \\binom{N}{k} \\cdot p^kq^{N-k} \\] We will not be dealing with lingusitic theories as well. No transformations. No movements. No bindings. This course is all about computational coding. library(tidyverse) summary_monthly_temp &lt;- weather %&gt;% group_by(month) %&gt;% summarize(mean = mean(temp), std_dev = sd(temp)) In the lecture notes, the text boxes in light blue refer to codes that you need to run in either terminal or your R/Python console. The text boxes in black background show the outputs of the code processing. We will follow this presentation convention throughout the entire lecture notes. print(&quot;Hello! R!&quot;) [1] &quot;Hello! R!&quot; Textbook Throughout the semester, we will follow the materials provided on our course website (see below). We will not use a particular textbook for the course. However, I do like to recommend Wickham and Grolemund (2017) for its simplicity. Also, another great book for R lovers, by Davies (2016): And two more comprehensive books for Python basics: Gerrard (2016) and Sweigart (2020): Course Website We have a course website. You may need a password to get access to the course materials. If you are an officially enrolled student, please ask the instructor for the access code.
