This is very important because scripts of good formats would increase their readability. This would save you a lot of time in case of future debugging and maintenace. This chapter will discuss common practices among most R users. 3.1 Assignment &lt;- In R, people normally use &lt;- to assign values to object names. In other languages such as Python, people often use =. While R usually would still understand the value-assignment when you use =, I would still suggest to use &lt;- just to avoid the chance of confusing your R. x1 &lt;- &quot;This is a sentence.&quot; x2 = &quot;This is a sentence.&quot; x1 ## [1] &quot;This is a sentence.&quot; x2 ## [1] &quot;This is a sentence.&quot; 3.2 Comment # When you write codes, you would need to commit your code extensively. This is very important because we often forget why and how we write it this way. In your R script, any strings after the # will be treated as comments, which will NOT be processed by R. We can often add additional - and = after the # to separate different code chunks. # ==================== # Variable Assignment # ==================== x &lt;- &quot;This is a sentence&quot; # ==================== # Variable Printing # ==================== x ## [1] &quot;This is a sentence&quot; 3.3 Script Naming When you name your R script files, don’t be TOO creative. Use meaningul strings. Most importantly, use alphanumeric characters ONLY. Never use Chinese characters. For multiword names, it is suggested to connect words with -. # Recommended my-first-script.R my-first-assignment.R # NOT Recommended my first script.R 語料庫assingment1.R 3.4 Object Naming In your script, you will create lots of objects. Spend some time thinking about how to name all these objects. Choose names that are intuitive and meaningful. It is often the case that you want to keep the names simple (as typing is really annoying) but easy to understand as well. There are some principles: Use nouns for the object names Use verbs for the function names (e.g., generate_ngrams()) Connect multiword names with _ (e.g., NTNU_corpus) Avoid using characters/strings that have been used by R (e.g., c, mean, sum, T etc.) 3.5 Whitespace For operators (i.e., =, +, -, &lt;-), they are usually embraced by whitespaces, which would make your script easier to read: # Recommended grade_average &lt;- mean(midterm * 0.5 + final * 0.5) # NOT Recommended grade_average&lt;-mean(midterm*0.5+final*0.5) For : and ::, usually we do not put whitespaces around them: # Recommended x &lt;- c(1:10) tidyr::separate() # NOT Recommended x &lt;- c(1 : 10) tidyr :: separate() For parentheses (, if it is in the control structure, we usually put a whitespace before the initial (: for (i in 1:10) if ( x == 1) But if the parenthesis is in the function call, we don’t put a whitespace before the initial (: mean(x) ggplot(aes(x = money, y = achievement)) For curely brackets, we usually put a linebreak after the initial { and the ending } should be one single line. Also, as sometimes you would embed many different control structures at the same time, leading to many ending } lines, it is always good to commit properly which ending } goes with which control structure. for (i in 1:10) { if (i &lt; 5){ print(i) } else { print(i+10) } #endif } #endfor ## [1] 1 ## [1] 2 ## [1] 3 ## [1] 4 ## [1] 15 ## [1] 16 ## [1] 17 ## [1] 18 ## [1] 19 ## [1] 20 3.6 Indention and Linebreaks R does not care about line breaks, whitespaces, or tabs in your R script. But these formating characters are important because you need all these characters to help you quickly keep track of your script. Make good use of the indention to increase the readability of your script. long_function_name &lt;- function(a = &quot;a long argument&quot;, b = &quot;another argument&quot;, c = &quot;another long argument&quot;) { # As usual code is indented by two spaces. } 3.7 More References Readability of your code is an art.
