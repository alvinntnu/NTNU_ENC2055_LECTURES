This tutorial is to show you how to use the ChatGPT service with R, which in turn can provide you additional assistance in future R scripts. C.1 Installation You can install the package from CRAN using the following command: # install.packages(&quot;remotes&quot;) remotes::install_github(&quot;jcrodriguez1989/chatgpt&quot;) Please check the chatgpt package documentation for more information about installation, setup, and usage. C.2 ChatGPT API API stands for Application Programming Interface. You can see it as a set of rules that lets different computer programs talk to each other. It is often needed when developers like to use service from an application. For example, when you use a self-created script to access data from YouTube, the script is talking to an API to get the media data. APIs allow different apps and programs to work together to create more complex systems. It’s like a language that different programs use to communicate with each other and share information. To use the ChatGPT service, you need to get an API key from OpenAI. You can get an API key by signing up for the OpenAI API at OPENAI API. After you obtain an OpenAI API, please copy-paste it in a safe document in private space. Please note that the API will no longer be available for copy-and-paste as soon as you closes the pop-up window. Once you have an API key, you can store it in your R environment as an environment variable using the Sys.setenv() function: Sys.setenv(OPENAI_API_KEY = &quot;your_api_key_here&quot;) Make sure to replace your_api_key_here with your actual API key. R Environment Variables Setup You can save the environment variable OPENAI_API_KEY in ~/.Renvion and every time when you starts your R session, the variable will be accessible. Run the following code and Rstudio will open the ~/.Renviron file for you: usethis::edit_r_environ() Go to the Rstudio Editing Frame and find the active file tab ~/.Renviron. In the ~/.Renviron, please add the following line to the file: OPENAI_API_KEY=&#39;your_api_key_here&#39; Re-start the RStudio, and run the following code to see if the API key is accessible now. ## Get the environment variables from the system default Sys.getenv(&quot;OPENAI_API_KEY&quot;) Or alternatively, you can save the environment variables at the OS level. Mac and Windows systems have different methods. Please see this article for more information. C.3 Using chatgpt Once you have installed the chatgpt package and set up your API key, you can load the package and specify your OPENAI API KEY (if it is not in your system/R environment variables): library(chatgpt) ## If you have set up environment variable in `~/.Renviron` ## You don&#39;t have to do anything # Sys.getenv(&quot;OPENAI_API_KEY&quot;) ## you can get if the environment variable is working ## If you have not set up the environment variable, ## please specify your OPENAI_API key here # OPENAI_API_KEY = &quot;your_api_key_here&quot; ## uncomment to specify API Parameters ChatGPT model parameters can be tweaked by using more environment variables. The following environment variables variables can be set to tweak the behavior, as documented in https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions/create. OPENAI_VERBOSE: If you want chatgpt not to show question messages in console, please set the environment variable OPENAI_VERBOSE=FALSE. OPENAI_MODEL; defaults to “gpt-3.5-turbo” OPENAI_MAX_TOKENS; defaults to 256 OPENAI_TEMPERATURE; defaults to 1 OPENAI_TOP_P; defaults to 1 OPENAI_FREQUENCY_PENALTY; defaults to 0 OPENAI_PRESENCE_PENALTY; defaults to 0 Sys.setenv(OPENAI_MAX_TOKENS = 2048) Sys.setenv(OPENAI_VERBOSE = FALSE) Ask Questions writeLines( ask_chatgpt( &quot;You are a R instructor. Can you give me a few specific suggestions on how to start learning the R programming language?&quot; ) ## endask ) ## endwrite 1. Start with the basics: Get familiar with the R Studio interface and become familiar with the basics of the R language such as data types, variables, and functions. 2. Take an online course: There are a number of great online courses available to learn R. A good place to start is Coursera’s Introduction to R course. 3. Work through tutorials: There are lots of great tutorials available on the web. Try working through the tutorials on the R-Project website to get a better understanding of the language. 4. Practice, practice, practice: The best way to learn any language is to just dive in and start coding. Set aside some time to practice coding and take on small projects. 5. Join a community: There are lots of great online communities for R users, such as R-bloggers, Stack Overflow, and the official R mailing list. Joining these communities is a great way to get help and to stay up-to-date on the latest developments in the language. writeLines( ask_chatgpt( &quot;Could you explain what a data scientist needs for their career?&quot; ) ## endask ) ## endwrite A data scientist needs a variety of skills and knowledge to be successful in their career. They should have a strong understanding of mathematics, programming, and statistics. They should also have experience with databases, data mining, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. They should be able to analyze large data sets and draw meaningful conclusions. In addition, data scientists should have strong communication, problem-solving, and critical thinking skills. They should be able to work independently, as well as collaborate effectively with other members of the team. Finally, data scientists should stay abreast of emerging trends and technologies in order to remain competitive. writeLines( ask_chatgpt( &quot;Can you tell us which programming language is better, python or R?&quot; ) ## endask ) ## endwrite Unfortunately, there is no single programming language that is universally “better” than the other. It depends on the specific application for which you are using the language. Python and R are both viable options for data science, machine learning, and statistical analysis, but Python is better for general-purpose programming tasks and R is better suited for statistical analysis. Ultimately, the best language for you will depend on the specific needs of your project. C.4 R Assistance Overall, ChatGPT can be a useful tool for providing comments and explanations of R scripts. By interacting with ChatGPT, you can get feedback, suggestions, and assistance with debugging and problem-solving. However, it’s important to keep in mind that ChatGPT is a language model and not a human expert, so its suggestions may not always be perfect or tailored to your specific needs. Comment Code Providing feedback on coding style: ChatGPT can provide feedback on coding style, including suggestions for formatting, naming conventions, and best practices. This can help you improve the readability and maintainability of your code. writeLines( comment_code( &quot;for (i in 1:10) {\\n print(i ** 2)\\n}&quot; ) ## endcomment ) ## endwrite # Loop through numbers 1 to 10 (inclusive) for (i in 1:10) { # Print the square of each number print(i ** 2) } Explain Code Providing code explanations: If you have a section of code that you don’t understand, you can ask ChatGPT to explain it to you. For example, you can ask “What does this line of code do?” and ChatGPT can provide an explanation of the code. writeLines( explain_code( &quot;for (i in 1:10) {\\n print(i ** 2)\\n}&quot; ) ## endexplain ) ## endwrite This code is a loop that prints the square of the numbers 1 to 10. The for loop is used to iterate through a sequence of values, in this case the numbers 1 to 10. The code i ** 2 is used to calculate the square of each value in the sequence. Each time the loop runs, the value of i is printed out as the square of itself. writeLines( explain_code( &quot;corp %&gt;% mutate(NumOfChars = nchar(texts), VowelPer = str_count(texts,&#39;[aeiou]&#39;)/NumOfChars, ConPer = str_count(texts,&#39;[^aeiou]&#39;)/NumOfChars) %&gt;% pivot_longer(c(&#39;VowelPer&#39;, &#39;ConPer&#39;), names_to = &#39;Segment&#39;,values_to = &#39;Percent&#39;) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(Segment, Percent, fill=Segment)) + geom_boxplot(notch=TRUE)&quot; ) ## endexplain ) ## endwrite This code is using dplyr and ggplot2 to analyze a dataset called &quot;corp&quot;. It uses the mutate() function to create two new variables for the dataset, NumOfChars and VowelPer, which represent the number of characters in each text, and the percentage of vowels in each text, respectively. The ConPer variable is also created, which represents the percentage of consonants in each text. The pivot_longer() function is then used to convert the new variables into a long format, with the names &quot;Segment&quot; and &quot;Percent&quot;. The ggplot() function is used to create a box plot, with the x-axis representing the &quot;Segment&quot; variable (vowels or consonants) and the y-axis representing the &quot;Percent&quot; variable (percentage of vowels or consonants). The &quot;notch=TRUE&quot; argument is used to create notched box plots. Document Code writeLines( document_code( &quot;squarenum &lt;- function(x){x^2}&quot; ) ## enddoc ) ## endwrite #&#39; Squarenum #&#39; #&#39; Returns the square of a number #&#39; #&#39; @param x A numeric value #&#39; #&#39; @return A numeric value, which is the square of the input #&#39; #&#39; @export #&#39; #&#39; @examples #&#39; squarenum(4) #&#39; [1] 16 #&#39; squarenum &lt;- function(x){ x^2 } #&#39; Squares a Number #&#39; #&#39; This function takes a number as an argument and returns the square of that number. #&#39; #&#39; @param x A number. #&#39; #&#39; @return The square of the number `x`. #&#39; #&#39; @examples #&#39; squarenum(4) #&#39; #&#39; @export #&#39; squarenum &lt;- function(x){ x^2 } Find Issues in Code Debugging assistance: If you are having trouble debugging your code, you can ask ChatGPT to help you find the error. ChatGPT can analyze your code and provide suggestions on where the error might be occurring. writeLines( find_issues_in_code( &quot;x &lt;- data.frame(index = c(1:4), text = letters[1:4]) writeLines(x[1])&quot; ) ## endfind ) ## endwrite 1. The code is missing a closing bracket at the end. 2. The code should be written as &quot;writeLines(x[1,])&quot; in order to return the full row. Optimize Code Suggesting improvements: If you have a section of code that is not working as expected, you can ask ChatGPT to suggest improvements. ChatGPT can analyze your code and suggest changes that may help fix the problem. Offering alternative solutions: If you are looking for alternative solutions to a coding problem, you can ask ChatGPT for suggestions. ChatGPT can offer different approaches to solving the problem and help you choose the best one for your needs. writeLines(optimize_code( &quot;x &lt;- data.frame(index = c(1:4), text = letters[1:4]) writeLines(x[1])&quot; )) writeLines(x$text[1]) writeLines(refactor_code( &quot;x &lt;- data.frame(index = c(1:4), text = letters[1:4]) writeLines(x[1])&quot; )) writeLines(x[x$index == 1, &quot;text&quot;]) C.5 Basic Natural Language Processing Overall, ChatGPT can be a powerful tool for performing basic NLP tasks. However, it’s important to keep in mind that it may not always be perfect or tailored to your specific needs. Additionally, more advanced tasks may require the use of other NLP tools or techniques.
