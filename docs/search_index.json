A.2 Shebang Line A.3 Basic Shell Commands Linux Man Pages The most basic commands are listed below: pwd (print working directory). Shows directory or “folder” you are currently operating in. This is not necessarily the same as the R working directory you get from getwd(). ls (list files). Shows the files in the current working directory. This is equivalent to looking at the files in your Finder/Explorer/File Manager. Use ls -a to also list hidden files, such as .Rhistory and .git. cd (change directory). Allows you to navigate through your directories by changing the shell’s working directory. You can navigate like so: go to subdirectory foo of current working directory: cd foo go to parent of current working directory: cd .. go to your “home” directory: cd ~ or simply cd go to directory using absolute path, works regardless of your current working directory: cd /home/my_username/Desktop. Windows uses a slightly different syntax with the slashes between the folder names reversed, \\, e.g. cd C:\\Users\\MY_USERNAME\\Desktop. Pro tip 1: Dragging and dropping a file or folder into the terminal window will paste the absolute path into the window. Pro tip 2: Use the tab key to autocomplete unambiguous directory and file names. Hit tab twice to see all ambiguous options. Use arrow-up and arrow-down to repeat previous commands. Or search for previous commands with CTRL + r. which Show the full path of a shell commands which python: Check which version of python your system uses which r: Check which version of R your system uses cp Copy files and directories rm Remove files and directories mv Move files and directories mkdir Make directories A.4 Text-Analytic Related Commands gzip [-cd#] FILENAME. Zips/Unzips a file. The zipped file created by gzip is often with the extension *.gz. -c: write output on standard output -d: decompress -#: Regulate the speed of compression using the specified digit #, where -1 or –fast indicates the fastest compression method (less compression) and -9 or –best indicates the slowest compression method (best compression). The default compression level is -6. tar [-j|-z] [cv] [-f FILENAME] filename.... Archive many files into one single file -j: Use bzip2 compression -z: Use gzip compression -c: Create a new archive -v: Print all files processed verbosely tar [-j|-z] [xv] [-f FILENAME] [-C PATH. Restore the original files from the achive file -j: Use bzip2 compression -z: Use gzip compression -x: Extract files from archive -v: Print all files processed verbosely C: Extract files to a particular path So when you see a file with the extention of *.tar.gz, this indicates that this file is a zipped file, which compresses a list of multiple files into one tar archive. Usually people pass their collection of multiple text files (i.e., a corpus) in this way because it is often easier to share one file instead of tons of files at a time. "]
